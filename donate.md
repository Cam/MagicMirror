Magic Mirror is an [opensource project on GitHub](http://github.com/jamztang/MagicMirror). The plugin is free to download for personal use, and opensource for code review and contributions.

Since initial launch, I have received tons of great feedbacks, use cases and feature requests. I really wanted to take this project to the next level, however it has to be sustainable. 

I thought of switching to be a purchase model, however the challenge is due to the fact that Sketch plugins are script based, users can always read and modify the source, we can never really make it a true priopritary product.

But anyway, I think it’s still fair to those who’s supporting the project. So, instead of the previous $5 donation option, there’ll be “premium” features for those who donated, please take a look at the “Coffee Menu”.

## Remarks

*Features with asterisks are not yet implemented but is in the road map.

The “Free Drip” contains no less than anything introduced in the original version of Magic Mirror, and will continue remains free with a reminder for every 10 time of usage.

The $5 dollar “Espresso” package will be anything in current v1.2 release, with the most recent enhancement that current doners are already enjoying.

The $10 dollar “Piccolo” will be just like “Espresso” for now, but is as a pre-support for the three upcoming features that I’m tempted to solve.

So I hope you enjoy using and continue to support Magic Mirror!
