## Why I make it paid?

Magic Mirror initially launch at 30 July has quickly become my most successful product. The plugin went on top of DesignerNews front page within hours, four days later cracked into TheNextWeb. Till now and counting, nearly 500 retweets is marked on this site. My email has received tons of feedbacks from awesome people, appreciations and feature requests.

Moreover, Google Analytics reported more than 10,000 page views in just 5 days. My Github recorded more than 2,200 downloads, plus an unknown number of people that uses SketchToolbox or the forgotten number that I've used Cloudly which got deleted due to traffic overused.

Sounds promising right? In fact, only 55 donations has been made in this 20 days. That's less than 2% of the users has taken out their pockets. Considering 10% been taken from using Paypal, a quick math can quickly evaluate the actualy number Magic Mirror made.

It's pretty clear that the donation modal will never be sustainable. There're basically two decisions for an individual developer:

1. Be nice to people and leave the modal unchange until something else takes up my time
2. Be a better product owner and do whatever it takes to continue focus and improve on the product

After days of thinking, my decision inevitably goes to #2.

To justify the value of Magic Mirror, I've taken a look at some others. One of the very rarely available commerical plugin for Sketch (originally came from Photoshop) charges for $39.99, designed to provide better markups on design specs. Another one creating perspective mockups in Photoshop selling for $19.99. Nothing else offer similar functionality like Magic Mirror does is yet available to Sketch user.

## Going from Donation to Freemium

It feels right to start the initial price of Magic Mirror at $10. The updated version will still be free for personal use, however advanced features will require a license key to unlock.

Early donors will regarded as already purchased the commercial license and will be able to use the advanced features :) (of course, man!)

A number of beta testers for v1.2 were amazed and satisfied with the new features.

> People who write down their goals are much more likely to achieve them

*Features with asterisks are just a few in my road map. There're a lot more plans I have with Magic Mirror. With the changes in the pricing modal, I am confident that we will create a better world for Sketch users and designers.
