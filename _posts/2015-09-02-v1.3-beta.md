And two handy updates!

Not anymore you need a mask layer or weird layout when trying to add some corners to your screen!

- Supporting Corner Radius
- New Shortcut: Clear Content

- Targeted Mirroring and Clear Content. So only selected screen will now apply to save redundant operations. If you want to apply to all screens in current page, just deselect all layers.


<div class="wrapper mx-auto flex">
  <form action="{{ site.downloadurl }}/{{ page.identifier }}" class="col-8 flex mxn2">
    <input type="text" class=" license-box mr1 p1 flex-auto" name="license" id="license" placeholder="Enter your license key..." />
    <input type="hidden" name="redirect_url" value="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}" />
    <input type="button" value="Download v1.3 Beta 2" class="border-box center btn btn-outline download mr1 p1" id="submitButton" identifier="{{ page.identifier }}"/>
  </form>
</div>
<div class="flex clearfix center">
  <p id="message" class="mt1 clearfix"></p>
</div>

{% include submitbutton.html %}

The old version required the path to have exactly 4 corners. When the shapes contains corner radius, the "Bezier Path" will includes two additional "control points" in corresponding corners.

Getting Corner Radius to work was more trickier than I initially thought, the feature now is still pretty much experimental, try out in both distorted shapes and normal shapes.

Always save a copy of your sketch file before trying out the new features :)

Please let me know if things works for you!
