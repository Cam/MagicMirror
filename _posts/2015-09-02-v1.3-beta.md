Not anymore you need a mask layer or weird layout when trying to add some corners to your screen!


- Supporting Corner Radius
- New Shortcut: Clear Content

<div class="wrapper mx-auto flex">
  <form action="{{ site.downloadurl }}/{{ page.identifier }}" class="col-8 flex mxn2">
    <input type="text" class=" license-box mr1 p1 flex-auto" name="license" id="license" placeholder="Enter your license key..." />
    <input type="hidden" name="redirect_url" value="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}" />
    <input type="button" value="Download v1.3 Beta" class="border-box center btn btn-outline download mr1 p1" id="submitButton" identifier="{{ page.identifier }}"/>
  </form>
</div>
<div class="flex clearfix center">
  <p id="message" class="mt1 clearfix"></p>
</div>

{% include submitbutton.html %}

The old version required the path to have exactly 4 corners. When the shapes contains corner radius, the "Bezier Path" will includes two additional "control points" in corresponding corners.

Getting Corner Radius to work was more trickier than I initially thought, the feature now is still pretty much experimental, try out in both distorted shapes and normal shapes.

Always save a copy of your sketch file before trying out the new features :)

Please let me know if things works for you!
