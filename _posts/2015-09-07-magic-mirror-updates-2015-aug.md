<div class="wrapper" markdown="1">

2015 Aug has been a crazy month. I added tons of new resources and new features, it is a truely amazing experience as an independant developer.

I would like to thank all the support in this community, and valuable
feedback that keep coming in throughout the month. Since launching at
30 July 2015 to 31 Aug, more than 28k visited the website, there're at
least 3k designers downloaded and tried Magic Mirror, that's such an
achievement for me! That's why I'm putting more time on this project, and I
made a new 50 seconds intro video yesterday (please turn on your speaker to enjoy :D)

Aside from the video, I've mentioned lots of stuffs that I've added in the
past month.

**3 New Features**

The latest beta version is 1.3 Beta 2, which added Corner Radius support
to our "Mirrors", together with other 2 handy shortcut and enhancement.

"card" effect](http://magicmirror.design/videos/) for your perspective mockup using Magic Mirror, let me know if that helps you to understand a bit more how things work!
